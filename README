#### Create a cluster using the ZollerLabCA for trust of harbor2.zoller.com
k3d cluster create foobar --volume /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/zollerlabca.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/yourcert.crt

#### Create a cluster with Pod Security Admission using a AdmissionControl file
k3d cluster create psa -c psa.yaml --volume /home/chip/docs/k3d/admissioncontrolfile.yaml:/etc/kubernetes/admissioncontrolfile.yaml

The config file looks like:

apiVersion: k3d.io/v1alpha4 # this will change in the future as we make everything more stable
kind: Simple # internally, we also have a Cluster config, which is not yet available externally
image: rancher/k3s:v1.24.2-k3s1 # same as `--image rancher/k3s:v1.20.4-k3s1`
options:
  k3s: # options passed on to K3s itself
    extraArgs:
    - arg: --kube-apiserver-arg=admission-control-config-file=/etc/kubernetes/admissioncontrolfile.yaml
      nodeFilters:
      - server:*

#### Create a cluster with ValidatingAdmissionPolicy enabled (i.e., CEL admission)

k3d cluster create cel -c validatingadmissionpolicy.yaml

#### Create a cluster with Pod Security Policy (PSP) enabled on 1.24

k3d cluster create psp -c psp.yaml

Once the cluster is up, you must apply psp-manifests-permissive.yaml so kube-system Pods can run.
You may need to delete ReplicaSets in kube-system after applying the manifest so a new one will get triggered.
